## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, carefully organized and managed with [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi). Chezmoi provides a secure, flexible framework for managing dotfiles across multiple machines, ensuring consistency and ease of setup.

These dotfiles represent my ideal development environment, optimized for productivity and adaptability across different operating systems and workflows.

## ✨ Features

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works in Linux (WSL2 for now)
- **Version control**: Managed with Git for easy tracking and collaboration
- **Secure secrets management**: Integration with Bitwarden
- **Modular configuration**: Easily add or remove components
- **Automated setup**: Quick installation with minimal manual steps
- **Self-documented**: Clear organization and documentation

## 💻 System Requirements

- **No prerequisites required!** 🎉
- A fresh Linux installation (Ubuntu, Debian, Raspberry Pi OS)
- Internet connection for downloading packages
- Sudo access for package installation

**Optional (installed automatically):**
- [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) - installed by the setup command
- [`Bitwarden CLI`](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/) - installed during setup
- Zsh - installed and configured automatically
- Git - installed during setup

## 🚀 Quick Start

### New Installation

```bash
# One-command installation (will prompt for machine type and sudo password)
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply osnabrugge
```

**What to expect:**
1. You'll be prompted to configure machine type (headless/ephemeral)
2. You'll need to enter your sudo password for package installation
3. After installation, **log out and back in** to activate zsh as your default shell
4. Bitwarden CLI will be installed automatically

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Install chezmoi first if needed
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)"

# Initialize dotfiles
chezmoi init osnabrugge

# Preview changes (recommended)
chezmoi diff

# Apply changes
chezmoi apply
```

## 🔐 Secrets Management

Personal secrets are stored in [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) and retrieved securely during setup.

**After installation**, authenticate with Bitwarden:

```bash
# After logging back in with zsh
bw login
```

The Bitwarden CLI is installed automatically during setup. If you see Node.js warnings, they're harmless - Bitwarden will work after authentication.

The setup scripts will securely fetch necessary credentials during installation.

## 🧩 Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Hammerspoon | macOS automation and window management |
| Oh-My-Zsh | Zsh configuration framework |
| SSH | Secure remote connections |
| GPG | Cryptographic key management |
| Git | Version control configuration |

## 🛠️ Customization

These dotfiles are designed to be easily customized:

1. Fork this repository
2. Modify the files to match your preferences
3. Update the install script if needed
4. Use `chezmoi` to apply your changes

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add containerized testing environment
- [ ] Impletment CI/CD for dotfiles updates
- [ ] Expand cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Create themed terminal configurations
- [ ] Add documentation for each major component
- [ ] Improve shell script performance
- [ ] Create specialized configurations for different use cases (development, server management, etc.)
